Let's solve these problems one by one:

**Chapter 2 Review/Test**

**1. What is the cost of 3 Bur Oak trees?**
From the table, the price for 3 or more Bur Oak trees is $32 each.
\[ 3 \times \$32 = \$96 \]
The cost of 3 Bur Oak trees is $96.

**2. Mr. Tan buys 4 White Pine trees and 5 Birch trees. What is the cost of the trees?**
From the table:
For White Pine:
Regular price = $40
Since he's buying 4, the price for each = $40
\[ 4 \times \$40 = \$160 \]

For Birch:
Price for 3 or more Birch trees = $8
\[ 5 \times \$8 = \$40 \]

Total cost = $160 + $40 = $200
The cost of the trees Mr. Tan buys is $200.

**3. Rudy will buy 3 Ivory Silk Lilac trees or 2 Bur Oak trees. He wants to buy the trees that cost less. What trees will he buy? How much will he save?**

For Ivory Silk Lilac:
Price for 3 or more = $22
\[ 3 \times \$22 = \$66 \]

For Bur Oak:
Price for 3 or more = $32
\[ 2 \times \$32 = \$64 \]

Rudy will buy the 2 Bur Oak trees as they cost less by $2. He will save $2.

**Page with Problems 6-8**

**6a.**
We see eight 4's adding up to 32.
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]
This means 8 times as many as 4 is 32.

**6b.**
We see six 8's adding up to 48.
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]
This means 6 times as many as 8 is 48.

**6c.**
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]
This means 9 times as many as 3 is 27.

**7. Multiply 7 × 43.**
\[ 7 \times 43 = 301 \]
7a. A reasonable estimate of the product is 280. - True (Rounding: 7 × 40)
7b. Using partial products, the products are 21 and 28. - True (Partial products: \(7 \times 3 = 21\) and \(7 \times 40 = 280\))
7c. Using regrouping, 21 ones are regrouped as 1 ten and 2 ones. - True
7d. The product is 301. - True

**8.**
It costs 3,928 points to build each apartment building in the computer game Big City Building. What is the cost to build 5 apartment buildings?
\[ 5 \times 3,928 = 19,640 \]
It costs 19,640 points to build 5 apartment buildings.

**For Question 4 and 5 (from the second image):**

**4. Mr. Tan buys 4 White Pine trees and 5 Birch trees. What is the cost of the trees? Show your work and explain how you found the answer.**
  
From the table:
White Pine regular price = $40, but price for 3 or more = $37 each
Birch regular price = $9 (since he's buying 5, the price remains the same because the discounted price is also for 3 or more trees)

Price for 4 White Pine trees: 
4 x $37 = $148 

Price for 5 Birch trees:
5 x $9 = $45

Total cost:
$148 + $45 = $193

**Answer:** Mr. Tan will pay $193 for the 4 White Pine trees and 5 Birch trees.

**5. Rudy will buy 3 Ivory Silk Lilac trees or 2 Bur Oak trees. He wants to buy the trees that cost less. What trees will he buy? How much will he save? Show your work.**

From the table:
Ivory Silk Lilac regular price = $25, but price for 3 or more = $22 each
Bur Oak regular price = $35, but price for 3 or more = $32 each

Price for 3 Ivory Silk Lilac trees:
3 x $22 = $66

Price for 2 Bur Oak trees:
2 x $32 = $64

Between $66 and $64, $64 is the lower amount.

**Answer:** Rudy will buy the 2 Bur Oak trees because they cost less. He will save $2 by choosing the Bur Oak trees over the Ivory Silk Lilac trees.

Note: The mathematics used here is simple arithmetic, and these types of problems help reinforce basic operations and decision-making.
